# Youtube Catify

Do you need more cats? Do you like cats? Of course you do. This extension adds cute cats to every thumbnail on youtube dot com.

Firefox Download: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-catify/

Notes:
* Original: https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube
* The extension doesn't work without a UUID key so you can't just download the respository and plug it into firefox and expect it to work
