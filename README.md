# Youtube Catify

Do you need more cats? Do you like cats? Of course you do. This extension adds cute cats to every thumbnail on youtube dot com.

Coming to Firefox Store soon!

Download yourself: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4142444/399182ec0a2b4425a3d5-1.xpi 
(this one works out of the box because it has a UUID key)

Notes:
* Original: https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube
* The extension doesn't work without a UUID key so you can't just download the respository and plug it into firefox and expect it to work
